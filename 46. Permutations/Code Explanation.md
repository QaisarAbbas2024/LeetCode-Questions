### **üîπ Python Code (Step-by-Step Explanation)**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def permute(self, nums):
```
- We define a class `Solution` with a function `permute(self, nums)`.  
- `nums` is the **list of numbers** we need to generate permutations for.

---

```python
        result = []  # List to store permutations
```
- We create an **empty list `result`** that will store all the valid permutations.

---

```python
        def backtrack(path, choices):
```
- We define a **helper function `backtrack`** to build permutations recursively.
- **`path`**: The current permutation being formed.  
- **`choices`**: The remaining numbers that can be used.

---

```python
            if not choices:  # Base case: all numbers used
                result.append(path[:])  # Store a copy of path
                return
```
- **Base Case:** If `choices` is empty, we have used all numbers.
- We add a **copy of `path`** to `result` because lists in Python are **mutable** (modifying `path` later would affect stored results).
- **Return to stop recursion**.

---

```python
            for i in range(len(choices)):  
```
- Loop through **each number** in `choices`.
- `i` represents the **index** of the current number in `choices`.

---

```python
                path.append(choices[i])  # Pick a number
```
- **Choose** the `i-th` number from `choices` and add it to `path`.

---

```python
                backtrack(path, choices[:i] + choices[i+1:])  
```
- **Recursive Call:**  
  - We call `backtrack` with the updated `path`.  
  - The new `choices` list is `choices[:i] + choices[i+1:]`, meaning:  
    - **We remove the picked number** and use the remaining ones.  

---

```python
                path.pop()  # Undo last choice (backtrack)
```
- **Undo the last step** (remove the last number added).  
- This **backtracks** to explore other possibilities.

---

```python
        backtrack([], nums)  # Start with an empty path
```
- We call `backtrack([], nums)` to start.  
  - `path = []` (initially empty).  
  - `choices = nums` (all numbers available).  

---

```python
        return result  # Return all stored permutations
```
- Finally, we **return the `result` list**, which contains all possible permutations.

---

## **üîç Example Walkthrough**
Let's see how it works for `nums = [1,2,3]`.

### **Step 1: Start**
```
path = []  choices = [1,2,3]
```

### **Step 2: Choose `1`**
```
path = [1]  choices = [2,3]
```
Recursive call...

### **Step 3: Choose `2`**
```
path = [1,2]  choices = [3]
```
Recursive call...

### **Step 4: Choose `3` (Base Case)**
```
path = [1,2,3]  choices = []
```
‚úÖ **Store in result**: `[[1,2,3]]`

### **Step 5: Backtrack**
- Remove `3`, back to `path = [1,2]`, choices = `[3]`
- Remove `2`, back to `path = [1]`, choices = `[2,3]`

---

### **Time & Space Complexity**
| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Backtracking** | `O(N!)` | `O(N!)` |

- **`O(N!)` Time:** Because there are `N!` (factorial) ways to arrange `N` numbers.
- **`O(N!)` Space:** Since we store all `N!` permutations.

---

## **üöÄ Summary**
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Start with an empty `path` |
| 2 | Pick a number and add to `path` |
| 3 | Remove it from `choices` and recurse |
| 4 | When no choices left, store the result |
| 5 | Undo (backtrack) and try next number |
| 6 | Repeat until all possibilities are explored |
