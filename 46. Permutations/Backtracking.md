### **Why Do We Undo (Backtrack)?**
Backtracking is like exploring **all possible paths** in a maze. When we reach a **dead-end** (i.e., we form a complete permutation), we need to **go back (undo the last choice)** and try a **different path**.

---

### **📌 Key Reason for Undoing (Backtracking)**
1. **We Need to Explore All Permutations**  
   - If we don’t undo, we will be **stuck** in one choice and won’t explore other possibilities.  
   - Each number should be placed **at different positions** in different permutations.

2. **We Are Using a Single `path` List**  
   - `path` is a shared list. If we don’t remove the last element, the next recursive call **will carry an incorrect state**.
   - Undoing ensures each recursive call starts with the **correct previous state**.

---

### **Example: Why Backtrack?**
#### **Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`**
#### **Recursive Steps (Without Undoing)**
Let’s follow what happens **if we don’t undo (remove the last number from `path`)**.

```
Step 1: Pick 1 → path = [1] → choices = [2,3]
Step 2: Pick 2 → path = [1,2] → choices = [3]
Step 3: Pick 3 → path = [1,2,3] → choices = []
✅ Store [1,2,3] in result
```
Now, we need to **try a different sequence** (like `[1,3,2]`), but if we don't undo, our `path` would remain `[1,2,3]`, and we wouldn’t be able to correctly explore other possibilities.

So, **we must remove the last number** and backtrack.

```
Step 4: Undo → Remove 3 → path = [1,2] → choices = [3]
Step 5: Undo → Remove 2 → path = [1] → choices = [2,3]
Step 6: Pick 3 → path = [1,3] → choices = [2]
Step 7: Pick 2 → path = [1,3,2] → choices = []
✅ Store [1,3,2] in result
```
Similarly, we backtrack again to explore `[2,1,3]`, `[2,3,1]`, `[3,1,2]`, and `[3,2,1]`.

---

### **🔹 What Happens If We Don't Undo?**
If we **don't undo**, we get incorrect results, and some sequences will **never be reached**.

Example (incorrect flow if no backtracking):
```
path = [1,2,3] → Stored [1,2,3] ✅
Next: Instead of undoing, we keep adding → path becomes [1,2,3,4] ❌ (wrong state)
```
This **breaks the algorithm**, and we cannot generate correct permutations.

---

### **🔹 Key Takeaways**
1. **Backtracking lets us explore different possibilities.**
2. **Each recursive call should start with a clean slate.**
3. **Undoing removes the last added number so we can try a new choice.**

### **🎨 Visual Representation of Backtracking (Leetcode 46 - Permutations)**  

Let's take an example:  

#### **Input:**  
```python
nums = [1, 2, 3]
```

---

### **🔹 Step-by-Step Tree Representation**

1️⃣ Start with an **empty `path`**  
```
[]
```

2️⃣ Pick `1`, remaining choices: `[2, 3]`  
```
[1]
```

3️⃣ Pick `2`, remaining choice: `[3]`  
```
[1, 2]
```

4️⃣ Pick `3`, no choices left → ✅ Store `[1,2,3]` in result  
```
[1, 2, 3] → ✅ Store
```
Now, **undo (backtrack) last choice (remove `3`)**  
```
[1, 2] ❌ ← Undo 3
```
Try the next choice `3` → **No other choice left, backtrack again**  
```
[1] ❌ ← Undo 2
```
Now, pick `3` instead of `2`  
```
[1, 3] 
```
Pick `2` → ✅ Store `[1,3,2]`  
```
[1, 3, 2] → ✅ Store
```
Backtrack again  
```
[1] ❌ ← Undo 3
```
```
[] ❌ ← Undo 1
```
---

Now, repeat for other numbers as first choices:

```
[2] → [2,1] → [2,1,3] ✅
[2] → [2,3] → [2,3,1] ✅
[3] → [3,1] → [3,1,2] ✅
[3] → [3,2] → [3,2,1] ✅
```

### **🌳 Full Backtracking Tree**
```
                          []
            ┌─────────────┴──────────────┐
           [1]                          [2]                        [3]
      ┌─────┴─────┐                ┌─────┴─────┐              ┌─────┴─────┐
     [1,2]      [1,3]            [2,1]      [2,3]          [3,1]      [3,2]
      │           │                │           │              │           │
    [1,2,3]    [1,3,2]          [2,1,3]     [2,3,1]       [3,1,2]     [3,2,1]  
```
✅ **Stored Permutations:**  
```
[[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]]
```

### **🔹 How Backtracking Works?**
1. Start with an empty list.
2. **Pick a number** from `nums`, add it to the `path`.
3. **Recursive call** to pick the next number.
4. When `path` has all numbers, **store it in result**.
5. **Undo (remove last number)** and try other options.
6. Repeat until all possibilities are explored.

---

### **🔹 Why Undo (Backtrack)?**
Without undoing:
- The list keeps growing and contains incorrect elements.
- We cannot generate correct permutations.
- Backtracking **removes the last choice** so the next recursive call starts fresh.
