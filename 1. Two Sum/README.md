### 🧠 Explanation:

---

```python
class Solution:
```
- 🔹 We're creating a **class** called `Solution` (LeetCode requires this).
- 🔹 Think of a class as a **blueprint or container** for our code — it groups related functions together.

---

```python
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
```
- 🔹 We're now **defining a function** called `twoSum` *inside* the class.
- 🔹 `self`: Just a way Python refers to the object itself (you can ignore it for now — it's automatic).
- 🔹 `nums`: This is the **list of numbers** you're given (like `[2, 7, 11, 15]`).
- 🔹 `target`: This is the **sum you want to reach** using two numbers from the list.

---

```python
        memory = {}
```
- 🔹 We create an **empty dictionary**, named `memory`.
- 🔹 A dictionary stores **key-value pairs**.  
   👉 Here, the key will be a number from the list, and the value will be its index.
- 🔹 We'll use it to **remember numbers we've already seen**, so we can look them up fast.

---

```python
        for index in range(len(nums)):
```
- 🔹 This means: “Go through every item in the list, one by one.”
- 🔹 `index` goes from `0` to `len(nums) - 1` — basically, we’re checking every number and its position.

---

```python
            needed = target - nums[index]
```
- 🔹 We're calculating the number that we **need** to reach the target.
- 🔹 For example, if `target = 9` and `nums[index] = 2`, then `needed = 9 - 2 = 7`.
- 🔹 This tells us: *“If I could find 7 somewhere earlier in the list, then 2 + 7 = 9 and I’m done!”*

---

```python
            if needed in memory:
```
- 🔹 This checks: “Did we already see the number we need?”
- 🔹 If yes, that means the pair `(needed + current number)` makes the target.
- 🔹 It’s like saying: “Oh hey! We’ve seen this before!”

---

```python
                return [memory[needed], index]
```
- 🔹 We return the **indexes** of the two numbers that make up the target.
- 🔹 `memory[needed]` gives the index of the earlier number (which we stored before).
- 🔹 `index` is the position of the current number.
- ✅ Done! We return them as a list.

---

```python
            memory[nums[index]] = index
```
- 🔹 If no match is found yet, we **store the current number and its index** in `memory`.
- 🔹 This way, we can **check for it later** when another number comes along.

---

### 📌 Example in Action:
Say:  
```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
```

1. `index = 0`, number = `2`, needed = `7` → not found → store `{2: 0}`
2. `index = 1`, number = `7`, needed = `2` → found! → return `[0, 1]`
